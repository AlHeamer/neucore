All API functions are documented with OpenAPI and can be found at 
[https://your.domain/api.html](https://neucore.herokuapp.com/api). Most of these endpoints are for the frontend, 
only the routes listed in the group `Application` are for Neucore applications. For these there is also a 
separate OpenAPI definition file at 
[https://your.domain/application-api-3.yml](https://neucore.herokuapp.com/application-api-3.yml).

## Application API

### Authentication

First an application must be created by an app administrator and assigned to an app manager, 
who can then generate the app secret.

Apps are authenticated using an HTTP authorization header.

The authorization string is composed of the word Bearer followed by a base64-encoded
string containing the app ID and secret separated by a colon (1:my awesome secret).

Example:
```
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer MTpteSBhd2Vzb21lIHNlY3JldA==" https://neucore.tld/api/app/v1/show
```

### Rate Limit

If the API rate limiting is configured (UI: Admin -> Settings -> Features), each response will contain 
the headers `X-Neucore-Rate-Limit-Remain` and `X-Neucore-Rate-Limit-Reset`. If enabled, each request results 
in an error 429 "Too many requests" if the limit has been exceeded.

## Player Accounts

### Character Registration

Each EVE character belongs to a player account, an account can have several characters.

When a character logs in via EVE SSO for the first time, a new player account is created
and that character is marked as the main character.

After a successful login, additional characters (alts) can be added to the account. This
is also done via EVE SSO.

If a character to be added to an account already belongs to another account, it will be
removed from that account and added to the current account. This can happen, for example,
if someone has accidentally created two accounts by logging in with an alt that has not
yet been added to the main account.

### Removing Characters

When it was detected that an EVE character is deleted or was transferred to another EVE account, 
it will be removed from its current player account.

An admin can also manually delete a character, a player can do this if that is enabled in the system setting.

All character removals are recorded and are visible to user admins.

### Account status

There a two account status: standard and managed.

- The status can be changed at any time by a user admin.
- If the status is changed, all groups are removed. New groups can be added manually in the same way as for normal 
  accounts.
- Automatic group assignment is disabled for managed accounts, "Required Groups" are still checked, see below.
- Groups are never deactivated for managed accounts.
- There is a separate login URL for managed accounts that does not require ESI scopes 
  (must be allowed in the settings).

## Groups

Visibility
- public: everyone can see them and apply to them.
- private: hidden from non-members
- conditioned: only visible to non-members if they meet certain criteria - not yet implemented

### Automatic Group Assignment

Alliances and corporations can be assigned to groups. These groups are then managed automatically. 
This means that every player who has a character in one of these alliances or corporations will 
automatically become a member of these groups.

Once a group has been removed from all alliances and corporations, it will no longer be managed 
automatically. This also means that all players who are currently members of this group will 
remain so. To correct this, this group can simply be deleted, or it must be assigned a manager 
who can then manually remove all members.

### Group Deactivation

If the ESI token of one or more characters on an account is invalid, the account can be disabled. This is done 
on the settings page, feature "Deactivate Groups". A character without a token (no ESI scopes were requested 
during login) counts as invalid.

Deactivation means that the API for apps no longer returns groups for that account. The deactivation of the 
account can be delayed, e. g. by 24 hours after a token became invalid.

As soon as the token was updated by logging in with the appropriate character, the account will be reactivated.

### Required Groups

Other groups can be added to a group as a prerequisite. This means that players must be members of all 
these other groups, otherwise they will be automatically removed from the group.

This check is also done for "managed" Player accounts (see "Account status" above).

## Member Tracking

Access to corporation member tracking data is configured by adding groups to a corporation whose 
members are allowed to see the data of that corporation.

The "tracking" role is automatically added to or removed from the player when this configuration is changed or 
members are added or removed from these groups.

## Watchlist

Corporations can be automatically added to the allowlist (and removed accordingly) if all their members 
are on the same account using the `auto-allowlist` command. This only works if at least one character in
that corporation has authorized the `esi-corporations.read_corporation_membership.v1` ESI scope.

The permissions are managed via groups, one for viewing and one for administration separately for each watch list.

## Mail Notifications

### Invalid ESI Token

An EVE mail can be sent for accounts with characters with an invalid ESI token.

This mail will only be sent once and only if one of the characters in the account is a member of an alliance 
that was previously configured. It will be sent to the main character, if any, or to one of the characters that 
have an invalid token.

### Missing Character

An EVE mail can be sent to characters that were not added to an account.

This mail will only be sent to members of configured corporations where member tracking must be enabled. It will 
only be sent if the character has logged in within a configurable number of days and will be sent again after the 
same number of days.

## Console Application

The console application has commands to:
- update characters with information from ESI, like corporation etc. 
- check ESI tokens of all character
- perform automatic group assignment based on corporation and alliance to group configuration
- update member tracking data
- send EVE mail to accounts with deactivated groups
- delete expired HTTP cache entries

## Data Structure (Backend)

 (partial representation)
 
![Entityâ€“relationship model](er-model.png)

- `players` identifies EVE players. Each player account can have one or more `characters`. One
  character is marked as the "Main" character, the rest are "Alts".
- `apps` are applications that have access to the "Application API". They can have several groups.
- A player account can be member of several `groups`.
- A player account can be manager of several groups and apps.
- `corporations` and `alliances` can have several groups for automatic group assignments.
- `roles` define what a player or app can do.
