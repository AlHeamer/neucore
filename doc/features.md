# Features

* EVE SSO login with configurable permission scopes
* Player accounts with alts
* Cron job for character updates from ESI
* Role based permission system
* Creation of groups and apps
* Group and app manager
* Group member management
* Automatic group assignment for players based on corporations and alliances from all of their characters
* An API for applications to query group membership of characters, corporations and alliances
* Limit groups that an app can see
* ESI request for authorized scopes for any character (very basic implementation so far)

Most of the functions are available in the frontend. Administrators can use the 
Swagger interface for the missing functions at `https://[domain]/api.html`.

## Player Accounts and Character Registration

Each EVE character belongs to a player account, an account can have several characters.

When a character logs in via EVE SSO for the first time, a new player account is created
and that character is marked as the main character.

After a successful login, additional characters (alts) can be added to the account. This
is also done via EVE SSO.

If a character to be added to an account already belongs to another account, it will be
removed from that account and added to the current account. This can happen, for example,
if someone has accidentally created two accounts by logging in with an alt that has not
yet been added to the main account.

## Console application

The console application has commands to:
- update characters with information from ESI, like corporation etc. and checks ESI tokens.
- perform automatic group assignment based on corporation and alliance to group configuration.


## Architecture

Backend and Frontend are developed as separated apps, they communicate via an API.
They can run on different domains as long as `[CORS][allow_origin]` is configured accordingly
in `backend/config/settings.php`.

A player logs in with EVE SSO. 3rd party applications authenticate with an HTTP header.

The API is documented with Swagger, it is available at `https://[domain]/swagger.json`.

For more details see the [**frontend**](../frontend/README.md) and [**backend**](../backend/README.md)
readme.

### Data Structure (Backend)

![Entityâ€“relationship model](er-model.png)

- `players` identifies EVE players. Each player account can have one or more `characters`. One
  character is marked as the "Main" character, the rest are "Alts".
- `apps` are 3rd party applications that have access to the "Application API". They can have several groups.
- A player account can be member of several `groups`.
- A player account can be manager of several groups and apps.
- A player can apply to groups.
- `corporations` and `alliances` can have several groups for automatic group assignments.
- `roles` define what a player or app can do.
