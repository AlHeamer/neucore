# Features

This primarily describes the back-end, most functions is not yet available
in the front-end. Admins must use the Swagger-UI for now (`https://[domain]/api.html`).

## Player Accounts and Character Registration

Each EVE character belongs to a player account, an account can have several characters.

When a character logs in via EVE SSO for the first time, a new player account is created
and that character is marked as the main character.

After a successful login, additional characters (alts) can be added to the account. This
is also done via EVE SSO.

If a character to be added to an account already belongs to another account, it will be
removed from that account and added to the current account. This can happen, for example,
if someone has accidentally created two accounts by logging in with an alt that has not
yet been added to the main account.

## Architecture

Backend and Frontend are developed as separated apps, they communicate via an API.
They can run on different domains as long as `[CORS][allow_origin]` is configured accordingly
in `backend/config/settings.php`.

A player logs in with EVE SSO. 3rd party applications authenticate with an HTTP header.

The API is documented with Swagger, it is available at `https://[domain]/swagger.json`.

For more details see the [**front-end**](../frontend/README.md) and [**back-end**](../backend/README.md)
readme.

## Data Structure (Backend)

![Entityâ€“relationship model](er-model.png)

- `players` identifies EVE players. Each player account can have one or more `characters`. One
  character is marked as the "Main" character, the rest are "Alts".
- `apps` are 3rd party applications that have access to the "App" API. They can have several groups.
- A player account can be member of several `groups`.
- A player account can be manager of several groups and apps.
- A player can apply to groups.
- `corporations` and `alliances` can have several groups for automatic group assignments.
- `roles` define what a player or app can do.
