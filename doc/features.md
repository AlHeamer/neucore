# Features

## Overview

* EVE SSO login with configurable permission scopes
* Player accounts with alts
* Cron job for character updates from ESI
* Role based permission system
* Creation of groups and apps
* Group and app manager
* Group member management
* Automatic group assignment for players based on corporations and alliances from all of their characters
* Optional account deactivation with mail notification when ESI tokens are invalid
* An API for applications to query group membership of characters, corporations and alliances
* Limit groups that an app can see
* ESI request for authorized scopes for any character (very basic implementation so far)

Most of the functions are available in the frontend. Administrators can use the 
Swagger interface for the missing functions at `https://[domain]/api.html`.

## Player Accounts

### Character Registration

Each EVE character belongs to a player account, an account can have several characters.

When a character logs in via EVE SSO for the first time, a new player account is created
and that character is marked as the main character.

After a successful login, additional characters (alts) can be added to the account. This
is also done via EVE SSO.

If a character to be added to an account already belongs to another account, it will be
removed from that account and added to the current account. This can happen, for example,
if someone has accidentally created two accounts by logging in with an alt that has not
yet been added to the main account.

### Removing Characters

If an EVE character is deleted or transferred to another EVE account, 
it will also be removed from its current player account.

A player can also manually delete a character if that is enabled in the system setting.

All character removals are recorded and visible to the user admin.

### Deactivation

If the ESI token of one or more characters on an account is invalid, the account is disabled. 
This means that the API for apps no longer returns groups for that account. The deactivation 
of the account can be delayed, e. g. by 24 hours after a token became invalid.

As soon as the token is updated by logging in with this character, the account will be reactivated.

A mail notification can be sent for deactivated accounts. This mail will only be sent once and 
only if one of the characters in the account is a member of an alliance that was 
previously configured. It will be sent to the main character, if any, or to any of the characters 
that have an invalid token.

## Automatic group assignment

Alliances and corporations can be assigned to groups. These groups are then managed automatically. 
This means that every player who has a character in one of these alliances or corporations will 
automatically become a member of these groups.

Once a group has been removed from all alliances and corporations, it will no longer be managed 
automatically. This also means that all players who are currently members of this group will 
remain so. To correct this, this group can simply be deleted, or it must be assigned a manager 
who can then manually remove all members.

## Console application

The console application has commands to:
- update characters with information from ESI, like corporation etc. and checks ESI tokens.
- perform automatic group assignment based on corporation and alliance to group configuration.

## Architecture

Backend and Frontend are developed as separated apps, they communicate via an API.
They can run on different domains as long as `[CORS][allow_origin]` is configured accordingly
in `backend/config/settings.php`.

A player logs in with EVE SSO. 3rd party applications authenticate with an HTTP header.

The API is documented with Swagger, it is available at `https://[domain]/swagger.json`.

For more details see the [**frontend**](../frontend/README.md) and [**backend**](../backend/README.md)
readme.

### Data Structure (Backend)

![Entityâ€“relationship model](er-model.png)

- `players` identifies EVE players. Each player account can have one or more `characters`. One
  character is marked as the "Main" character, the rest are "Alts".
- `apps` are 3rd party applications that have access to the "Application API". They can have several groups.
- A player account can be member of several `groups`.
- A player account can be manager of several groups and apps.
- A player can apply to groups.
- `corporations` and `alliances` can have several groups for automatic group assignments.
- `roles` define what a player or app can do.
