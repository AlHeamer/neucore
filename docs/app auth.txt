Authentication for apps is done via an HTTP Authorization header.

The authorization string is composed of the word Bearer followed by a base64-encoded
string containing the app ID and secret separated by a colon (1:my awesome secret).

Example:
$ curl --header "Authorization: Bearer MTpteSBhd2Vzb21lIHNlY3JldA==" https://brave.core.tld/api/app/info
