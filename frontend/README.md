# Typescript Vue Frontend

## Setup

- `npm i`

## Commands

- `npm run build` for a dev build
- `npm run watch` for dev rebuild on change
- `npm run check` to lint and validate frontend
- `npm run build:prod` for a minified production build

## TODO

- have travis run `npm run check`
- might be reasonable to setup vuex if we have to manage lots of state between components, or vue-router for multiple pages.

- login button
- handle returning from login
- show user info
