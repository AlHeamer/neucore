# Quick 'n' Dirty Frontend

This contains a minimal frontend that users can use to
add their alts to their account.

The corresponding HTML file is `web/index.html`.

It depends on the `web/swagger.json` file that is generated by the back-end.

Generate Swagger client, install dependencies and build:

```
./swagger.sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Rebuild on change:
```
npm run watch
```
