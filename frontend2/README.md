# Frontend

This contains a minimal frontend that users can use to
add their alts to their account.

It depends on the `web/swagger.json` file that is generated by the backend.

Generate Swagger client, install dependencies and build:

```
./swagger.sh
npm install
npm run build
```

For production use: `npm run build:prod`.

Rebuild on change:
```
npm run watch
```
